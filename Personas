<h2>Problem statement: Enhancing Work-Life Balance for Remote Workers</h2>

<p>

Remote workers often face challenges in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, as the home environment blurs the lines between work and personal life. This overlap leads to extended work hours, diminished personal time, and increased stress, impacting overall well-being and productivity. There is a need for effective strategies to delineate work and personal spaces, ensuring a balanced lifestyle for those working from home.
